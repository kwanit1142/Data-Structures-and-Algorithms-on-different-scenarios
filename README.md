Using linked list, write a program to add, subtract and evaluate polynomials: P1(x), P2(x), P3(x) and P4(x) where P1(x) and P2(x) are input polynomials and P3(x) = P1(x)+P2(x) and P4(x)=P1(x)-P2(x). Each node in the linked list correspond to a term in the polynomial. So, in your node structure - you may keep two data components – integers pow and coeff; and one pointer to the next node.

### Input Format:

First line mentions K i.e. the number of test cases. Then there are three lines for each test case, In the first two lines of a test case, First number indicate the highest degree of polynomials N and then there are N+1 integers which are the coefficients of polynomial terms in descending order. In the third (and last line) of a test case, there is one integer i.e. value of x for which you need to evaluate the polynomials. (Constraints: 0≤K≤50, 0≤N≤9, -2≤x≤2, and Input coefficient terms would be between -100 to +100; Assume you can safely do calculations for each polynomial term without worrying about underflow/overflow issues).

### Note: 

There is a single space before and after =, +, -, and : in the output. There should be NO nodes in the linked list for the polynomial terms having 0 coefficient value. In the above example, the polynomials f1 and f2 were to be represented using 4 and 2 nodes in the linked list, respectively

### Remarks: 
There are three test cases in 2nd Sample Input. Remember to appropriate free the memory space after each test case. Input would be read from terminal (i.e. stdin) and not from any file
